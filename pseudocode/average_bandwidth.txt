1. Initialize a variable `total_bytes_transferred` to 0 to store the sum of all data transferred.

2. Initialize `start_time` to the timestamp of the first transaction in the trace. (Set it when you encounter the first transaction)

3. Initialize `end_time` to the timestamp of the last transaction in the trace. (Update it as you parse each transaction)

4. Parse each line of the simulator trace:
   For each line:
     a. Extract the `timestamp`, `TxnType`, and `Data` size from the line.
     b. If `TxnType` is either "Rd" or "Wr":
       - Convert the `Data` size from the hexadecimal or any given format into bytes.
       - Add the size of `Data` to `total_bytes_transferred`.

5. Calculate the total time in cycles:
   `total_cycles` = `end_time` - `start_time`

6. Calculate bandwidth in Bytes per cycle:
   `bandwidth_per_cycle` = `total_bytes_transferred / total_cycles`

7. Convert `bandwidth_per_cycle` to Bytes per second (assuming cycle time or clock frequency is known):
   `bandwidth_per_second` = `bandwidth_per_cycle` * `clock_frequency_in_Hz`

8. Return `bandwidth_per_second`.
